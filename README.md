# Todo Cloud

Todo Cloud is the next step in the evolution of the [Todo MVC app](http://todomvc.com) showing how to take the classic JavaScript app and give it a backend that runs in the cloud.

## Running locally

To run the app locally, make sure the backend is running locally. Instructions can be found for each backend in the README located in the backend's respective folder. For example, to run the Azure backend, follow the readme in the Azure folder.
