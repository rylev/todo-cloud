# Todo Cloud

Todo Cloud is the next step in the evolution of the [Todo MVC app](http://todomvc.com) showing how to take the classic JavaScript app and give it a backend that runs in the cloud.

## Running locally

### Backend

First, make sure the backend is running locally. Instructions can be found for each backend in the README located in the cloud provider's respective folder. For example, to run the Azure backend, follow the README in the `azure` folder.

### Client

Once the backend is running, run the client simply by opening `client/index.html` in your browser.
