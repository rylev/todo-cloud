# Todo Cloud Client

The Todo MVC app that serves as the frontend for the Todo Cloud backend.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally simply open the `index.html` file. If the app makes calls to the backend, it will fail unless you're either running the backend locally or you change the app to hit a backend running in the cloud.

Follow the instructions in the main README for more information.
